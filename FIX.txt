LUBUNTU AUDIO FIX:



So for users having difficulties with their audio settings in Lubuntu, i suggest installing pulseaudio and pavucontrol:

Code:
sudo apt-get install pulseaudio pavucontrol


Restart. In order to get your multimedia keys working, edit your openbox rc.xml:

Code:
nano .config/openbox/lubuntu-rc.xml

and edit the 'Keybinding for Volume management' section to the following:

Code:
    <keybind key="XF86AudioRaiseVolume">
      <action name="Execute">
        <command>amixer -q -D pulse sset Master 3%+ unmute</command>
      </action>
    </keybind>
    <keybind key="XF86AudioLowerVolume">
      <action name="Execute">
        <command>amixer -q -D pulse sset Master 3%- unmute</command>
      </action>
    </keybind>

Hope this helps.
